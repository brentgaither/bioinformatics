1. There is a mutation in both alleles. Allele A has a mutation around codon 360 and
allele B has a mutation around codon 1650.  
2. There is a mutation in allele B at amino acid 550. Allele A had a mutation in the codon
but it was a silent mutation. 
3. Mary has mutations in each of her alleles however only one of the mutations causes a
different amino acid. This means allele B is what is causing the CF. This mutation must
cause a change in how the protein is created and is the reason she is a CF carrier.
4. Tom has a mutation around 1520 in allele A. This is a nonsense mutation at around
amino acid 510.
